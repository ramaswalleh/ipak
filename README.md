A survey instrument that I developed for IPA-Wash Benefits program built on Blaise 4.8 (CAI platform) for the basline round of data collection that ran between 2012 and 2013. It also includes logic for automating data aggregation collected from multiple devices to a centralised shared folder, as well as logic for converting this data into widely compatible CSV format for easier collaboration.
